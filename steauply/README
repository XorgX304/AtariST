8b signed PCM .AU player for Atari STE
(c) 2016 nanard

This audio player uses STE DMA sound to
play 8bit signed PCM audio data at the
4 possible rates :
50066Hz / 25033Hz / 12517Hz / 6258Hz
Any .AU file will be played at the
closest of theses 4 sample rates.
Mono and stereo are supported.

Standard GEMDOS Fopen/Fread are used to
get the data from disk.

In order to convert your audio files to
the right format, I advise you the SoX
tool : http://sox.sourceforge.net/

usage example :
$ sox input.mp3 -r 50066 -b 8 \
 -e signed-integer ouput.au

ffmpeg can also be used. It is faster
but do not put metadata in header :
$ ffmpeg -i 'input.mp3' -ar 25033 \
 -f au -c pcm_s8 -ac 1 output.au
